# RealTimeChatApp
Real Time chatting application is similar with other chat applications we already have in the market. Like Whatsapp, messenger etc etc.... and is also inspired by mainly by Whatsapp. This App focused in using the feasable and very much popular technology we have in market named 'Firebase'. 

## History
This application was initiated by me in late 2017. Application was build to improve my skills in building android application also to explore the new firebase features introduced in Google i/o '17.

## Future Scope
Our mainly focus will be end-to-end encription because some of user's most personal moments will be shared by this app, which is why we focus on bulding end-to-end encryption into the latest versions of our app. When end-to-end encrypted, user's messages and calls are secured so only user and the person user is communicating with can read or listen to them, and nobody in between, not even our team :-)
